Reading Response Papers
-----------------------

Students will be asked on a few occasions to post brief responses to the readings on the class website during the course of the semester (roughly one for each part of the course, for a total of three). These responses should consist of 200–300 words on a topic / question that will be posted on the class website two weeks before the responses are due. Your responses should be thoughtful and thought-provoking. You are not expected to do any extra preparation for these posts. You will receive a composite grade for all three of your forum posts and that grade will form a portion of your overall final grade.

Debates
-------

We will hold two in-class debates during the course of the semester. The class will be divided into two teams and each side will be asked to prepare a "pro" or "con" position as represented by the readings for that day. You will be evaluated on your debate performances as part of your overall class participation portion of the final grade.
